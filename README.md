**Project Overview:**

This project aims to explore the application of reinforcement learning (RL) in penetration testing (pentesting) using Capture-the-Flag (CTF) challenges. We investigate the trade-offs between model-free learning and a priori knowledge in the context of RL-based pentesting agents.

**Objectives:**

* Develop an RL-based pentesting agent using a model-free learning approach.
* Incorporate a priori knowledge into the RL agent to enhance its performance.
* Evaluate the performance of the RL agent with and without a priori knowledge using CTF challenges.
* Analyze the trade-offs between model-free learning and a priori knowledge in RL-based pentesting.
